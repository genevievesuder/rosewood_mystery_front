## Welcome to Rosewood Public Library
<hr/>
In this video game, players are thrown into a mystery at a library. The game is filled with romance, betrayal, and secrets. As players navigate through the library, they must uncover clues and solve puzzles to unravel the mystery. Along the way, they will encounter a cast of characters, each with their own stories to tell.
Is something supernatural going on, or have you read one too many scary stories?
